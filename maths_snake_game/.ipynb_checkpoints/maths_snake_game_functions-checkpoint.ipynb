    "Here, we create a variable called $middle\\_odd$. This will work out the median when a list has an odd number of elements. In order to get the median, we need to find the element with the index of half the length of the list. In order to do this, we can take the length of the given list, using the $len$ function, and then integer divide (floor divide) the value by 2. This will then yield us the middle index of the list, thus allowing us to obtain the value at that index location; i.e the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if for any reason you do not want to use the integer divide (floor divide) operator, you can use the $floor$ function included in the $math$ library and simply divide by 2:\n",

    "Here, we create a variable called $middle\\_even$. This will work out the median when a list has an even number of elements. When the list has an even number of elements, we need to add up the two middle values and divide by 2 in order to get the median of the data. This is possible by adding up the two middle indexes of the list and finding the values corresponding to those list indexes. In order to get the first middle number, we can take the middle index, as worked out in the $middle\\_odd$ variable, and subtract 2. The reason why we subtract 2 from the middle index value is because the floor divide operator always rounds down to the nearest integer value and python list slicing is exclusive. We use python list slicing in order to find the indexes of both middle elements. The $sum$ function allows us to add up the values which correspond to the two list indexes. The sum of both values is then divided by two in order to obtain the median.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, depending on the length of the given list, either the median odd value or the median even value is returned. If the length of the list divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0, then the second tuple item is returned, else, the first tuple value is returned."
